# Stack
warm up to classes in C++, including dynamic memory 

Create a Stack class that handles PRIME INTEGERS only, using a dynamic array implementation. It should be able to automatically resize (to a larger size only) when full, becoming 1.5 times larger than it was. The stack class must contain the standard public functionality of push(), pop(), empty(). The only additional public functionality allowed is a peek() or top() method, depending upon your design choice.

Due to the use of a dynamic array, you must also provide the copy constructor, overloaded assignment operator and destructor.
